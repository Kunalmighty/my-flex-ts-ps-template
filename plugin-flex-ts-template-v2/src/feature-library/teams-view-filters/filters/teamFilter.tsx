/* 
  This filter is based on the model of the worker attibutes adopted from
  flex insights.  For a definition of that model see:

  https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/insights/enhance-integration#enhance-agent-data
  
  The worker team name may be pushed into the worker object through SSO
  or it may be managed directly in flex using some worker customization
  tool.

  In either case a predefined list of teams needs to be configured so that
  it can be selected from to search the workers for matching team names

  Ideally we would be able to get a unique lit of team names from a lookup
  but there is no consistent way to do this without a backend solution.

  If building tooling in the solution to allow supervisors the ability
  to edit and apply team name, synconrizing these options should be 
  a consideration.
